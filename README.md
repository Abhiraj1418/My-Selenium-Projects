# My-Selenium-Projects
This repository contains Python code for automating a web page using Selenium Webdriver. 
You can use this code to understand how to find elements using Xpath and automate a webpage.
You can run this code on Pycharm or any other IDE.
Note: You must have selenium installed in your system.
There is an attached Excel File of Manual Test Cases which will help you to understand how to write manual testcases while testing a webpage.
I have uploaded a Defect Report file so you can understand how to report a bug once you indentify it.
